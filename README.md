# Pupper Playdate Finder

This is going to be an app similar to Tinder, except for dog parents trying to find friends for their pets. The parents will create a profile for their pet with pictures and a bio. Then they will have a feed that will pull up nearby pets that might be a good match for their pet. If they like some one they will have the option to like them and send them a message. Parents will have the option to answer or decline messages they receive. The app will only use appropriate locations.
